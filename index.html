            <h2>What is WebDAV?</h2>
            "WebDAV stands for "Web-based Distributed Authoring and Versioning". It is a set of extensions to the HTTP
            protocol which allows users to collaboratively edit and manage files on remote web servers." Taken from <a
                href="http://www.webdav.org/">http://www.webdav.org/</a>
            <br>
            <br>
            In simple terms, WebDAV is a web protocol that allows a webpage to act as a server that multiple people can
            access at one time.

            <h2>What can WebDAV do?</h2>
            WebDAV lets users set up private servers that can be accessed from anywhere. They can upload, download,
            rename, move and delete files freely,
            as if the flie was local on their own computer. These servers can be protected with usernames and password
            settings which means that only
            allowed users can access the server.

            <h2>Why should I use WebDAV?</h2>
            WebDAV is useful for geographically disperse teams because it means that they can all access the files they
            need and know that only people
            with permission have access to those files. In addition, WebDAV has features in place that protects the
            files from being overwritten by
            two different users. The feature, <em>Locking</em>, means that files are checked out to a user for a period
            of time where the file can
            only be used by them without fear that their coworker or peer is editing the same file. The user is check
            out the file for a configurable
            amount of time and can be checked in anytime between then and the user completing their use of the file.
            <br>
            WebDAV also supports XML which means that the user can store, set and delete metadata on the server. A use of this would be a list of all the 
            authors on the project, a contact list for the users, or a log of who edited what file when.

            <h2>Where can I learn more?</h2>
            While out of date, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120626092812/http://webdav.org/">WebDAV.org</a>
            (presented by way of WayBack Machine to avoid lost links) is one of the more complete repositories of WebDAV
            information. This webpage would not be possible without it's existance.

            <a href="https://www.comparitech.com/net-admin/webdav/"><i>WebDAV: What it is, where it turns up, and its alternatives</i></a> by John Kimball
            is another simple guide to WebDAV. It lists <i>where</i> WebDAV is found and compares and contrasts WebDAV with other hosting protocalls.
